Hi! I am Matej (or Matthew) and welcome to my site. If you're here you might be wondering who I am, so tldr; I am currently a masters student of computer science in TU Delft. I am following the AI track as I found AI to be a big pasison of mine during the bachelor. Outside of my student life, I am a big fan of history and urban planning. I joined many projects or side experiments along the way, and most of them will be listed later in this site, but as a quick overview, I started in high school with some game projects in python like snake, tetris, etc. I also became a big fan of arduino projects, resulting in 3D room scanner based on ultrasound sensor, some dynamos and a python script to show the collected data. During my bachelor studies I followed intrest into algorithimcs, where I join every year for Advent of Code and followed the Algorithms honours programme for year and a half, and I also followed my interest for AI, ML and data in general, with projects from kaggle or some uni based hackathons. Overall I would say I am quite hard working for things I get excited about, and the more challenging a task is, the easier it is to get excited about it. i like to work on projects in teams, as I believe that if someone gets to see what I\m doing and vice versa, a lot of simple errors can be avoided. That is why I enjoy to work as a teaching assistant where I get to work with many amazing and smart people. Of course my journey is still ongoing, I still have multiple goals I would like to achieve until I finish my studies, like losing weight or finishing some books I started a while back. I hope this overview gave you a basic idea of who I am and I hope you get to enjoy this site.
